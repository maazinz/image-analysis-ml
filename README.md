In this project, we were required to perform semantic segmentation on given images of skin carcinoma. Any given image could be classified into up to 12 different segments, namely: Glands (GLD), Inflammation (INF), Hair Follicle (FOL), Hypodermis (HYP), Reticular Dermis (RET), Papillary Dermis (PAP), Epidermis (EPI), Keratin (KER), Background (BKG), Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) & Intra-epidermal Carcinoma (IEC).

After segmentation, we were required to classify each image into one of three classes: BCC, SCC and IEC. We were instructed to verify our accuracy by applying a performance metric. In this case, we had to create a confusion matrix and find the accuracy

The given dataset had a total of 1500 images, from which 1400 were to be used for training and 100 for testing. The dataset can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qGGai4oB2jt1skkMIBEBLTmSjwukAaZQ/view
